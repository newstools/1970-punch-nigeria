As tension heightens in Ukraine following Russia’s invasion, families, including children and pets, have reportedly crowded into a subway station in Kharkiv, on Thursday, seeking shelter from the bombing. The Cable News Network reported that the station, which would have been full of commuters making their way back and forth to work had Russia not launched its so-called “special military operation,” is now serving as a bomb shelter for many. “It’s just absolutely surreal. Yesterday, this would have been full of commuters making their way back and forth to work. Today, it has become an impromptu bomb shelter,” CNN reported. The report further stated that, “People started to pour in … These people are frightened. They’re confused. They are desperately uncertain about what they’re supposed to do, how long they can take shelter here, where they go from here.” CNN had earlier reported that rockets were launched from the Belgorod region in Russia over the border near Kharkiv. Also, military vehicles were reportedly seen headed toward the road leading to the city. Earlier in January 2022, in an interview with the Current Time television network, the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, had hinted that his city’s subway system would be turned into a giant bomb shelter should Russia invade Ukraine.
