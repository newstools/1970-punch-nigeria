NIGERIAN striker Taiwo Awoniyi came off the substitute’s bench to score his 10th Bundesliga goal of the season – 20th for Union Berlin who ended a poor run of three games without a win and goal with a convincing 3-1 victory over Mainz on Saturday. It was the first time Awoniyi would score from the substitutes’ bench as a Union player. The 24-year-old came on for Andreas Voglsammer in the 67th minute and tapped in his side’s third in the 75th minute after Genki Haraguchi and Sheraldo Becker had shot Die Eisernen into a two goal lead. Dutch striker Delano Burgzorg scored Mainz’s late consolation. The strike ended his six-game goal drought with his last against RB Leipzig in a 2-1 win on December 3. The win took Union Berlin to seventh position on the Bundesliga table with 37 points from 24 games. They have won 10, managed seven draws and lost as many, scoring 32 goals in the process and conceding as many. After the loss, Mainz dropped to ninth in the log with 34 points. Just like their opponents, they have played 24 games, winning 10, drawing four and losing 10. They have scored 35 goals and conceded 29. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
