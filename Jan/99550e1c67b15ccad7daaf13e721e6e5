The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, has described the winner of the Ekiti State Primary elections, Olabisi Kolawole, as the best fit to fly the party flag in the forthcoming governorship election on June 18. Ayu spoke on Tuesday at the Party’s National Secretariat, Abuja, during the presentation of Certificate of Return to Kolawole, who won the party primaries last week. The former Senate President said Kolawole understands the rudiments of Ekiti State politics having served in the state House of Assembly, as civil Commissioner and later the state Chairman of the party. “Bisi Kolawole has seen all as a politician. He is a perfect fit as our candidate. He was a member of the state house of assembly, he was a commissioner in the state and later PDP Ekiti State Chairman. So, Kolawole is a well-bred politician. “Let me appeal to our brothers and sisters in Ekiti State to put behind all their grievances and work towards the success of our party. It is only when we win that we can sit down and talk better,” he said. On their part, Delta State Governor, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa, representing the PDP Governors and Professor Jerry Gana representing the Board of Trustees pledged their support for Kolawole, affirming that winning Osun and Ekiti states will ultimately “send the All Progressives Congress out of Aso Rock.” In his remarks, Kolawole thanked the National Working Committee for their efforts. He said his emergence as the party candidate was the beginning of the PDP revolution in Ekiti state. “I want to sincerely thank our national leaders for putting our party in the right direction. Let me assure you that my emergence is the beginning of the PDP revolution in Ekiti State. “Ekiti State has been on steady progress before the interruption of the All Progressives Congress. Now, there is suffering, hunger, security problems; pensioners are dying, all these things will change when I enter as governor of Ekiti State,” he said.
