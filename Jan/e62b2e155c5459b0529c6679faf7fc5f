NIGERIA international Odion Ighalo says he has no regrets playing for Manchester United, adding that he will be a fan of the club “till death.” The 32-year-old joined the Red Devils in a deadline day move in January 2020, accepting a pay cut from Shanghai Shenhua. The former Watford striker made 23 appearances for the club, scoring five times and providing one assist, before his exit in 2021. Despite not winning a trophy at the club, the Nigerian looks back at his time there with pride. “In years to come, you need something to show your children, “Ighalo told ESPN. “I have been talking to my children about Manchester United, the experience. “I left Old Trafford with pride, with my head up, because it was my dream team and not everybody’s dream comes to pass. Mine came to pass so every day of my life, I’m grateful. “To be the first Nigerian to play there and so far the only Nigerian, those are great achievements for me and I did well so I’m happy for that. “The atmosphere in Old Trafford is different. It is a big club. If you’re not inside, you don’t know how big the club is. It is a massive, massive, massive club. “So, I thank God I played for the biggest club in the world, it’s an achievement for me and when you say, “what I should do better? I think I did everything I should do. I worked hard, I scored a few goals and I’m happy. “I don’t have one regret; I have zero regrets for my time at Manchester United. They are still my team till today and I’m going to support that team to death. “Even when they are struggling, I will still support them because it is Red Devils all the way.” Copyright PUNCH.
