Timaya nearly killed my sister this morning. He hit her with his car and run at Ikate few hours ago. “He hit my sister’s car and she came down to ask him to look at what he did. This heartless human was asking for number and she told him he would block her. Instead of @timayatimaya to do the needful, he hit my sister with his car and ran away. “She is at the hospital right now in serious pain and the funniest part is that I messaged him on Instagram to do the needful, but this wicked fellow blocked me after reading my message.” To back up her claims, she further shared screenshots of her chat with Timaya. Omownmi also shared videos of her bleeding sister who was undergoing treatment. The victim was injured on the head and leg. Efforts to reach Timaya, as of the time of filing this report, were not successful. His manager did not pick up her calls, nor did she respond to the messages sent by our correspondent.
